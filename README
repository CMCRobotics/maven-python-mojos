Maven Python Mojos
==================

A collection of Mavne plugins that allows to integrate useful tools written in Python (or Ruby in some cases)
into the Java build lifecycle.

This allows Java shops to use the vast collection of Python libraries for things such as BDD integration testing
or site & documentation generation.

Development Tools
-----------------
For Python development tools within a Java shop we recommend:

* PyDev: http://pydev.org
* Aptana Studio: http://aptana.com/
* NetBeans Python plugin: http://wiki.netbeans.org/Python
